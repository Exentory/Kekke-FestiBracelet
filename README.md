# RF-SmartBracelet
This Repository contains the code for both the Transmitter module as the Reciever module for a school project using multiple arduino's,
433MHz RF radio module transmitter and recievers and RFID reader and scanner modules.

## The Bracelet
The bracelet contains an Arduino Nano, the radio reviever module,LEDs, rechargable batteries and the RFID tag module. The bracelet is a prototype to be used at a festival. Payments can be made using the build in RFID tag, and a light show can be played on every bracelet at a festival trough the radio modules.

## The Transmitter
The transmitter contains an Arduino Uno, the radio transmitter module and some buttons. The module will be used in combination with a pc, and unique color and speed combinations will be written as serial data from the pc to the transmitter, which will send the data as bytes to the bracelet.
